Welcome to the Weather Report App, a web application that allows users to search for weather details of different cities and view the current weather conditions. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Search for Cities:** Users can search for a city or airport using the input field and the "Add City" button. Upon clicking the button, the app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the city name entered.

- **Weather Cards:** The app dynamically generates weather cards for each city added. Each card displays the temperature, weather type, atmospheric pressure, and a weather icon.

- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices and screen sizes.

## Getting Started

To run the Weather Report App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Dependencies

The Weather Report App utilizes the following external resources:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): For icons used in the app's user interface.
- [Animate.css](https://animate.style/): For smooth animations and transitions.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of the city or airport in the search input field.

2. Click the "Add City" button to fetch and display weather information for the entered city.

3. Weather cards will be dynamically created and displayed below the search bar, showing the temperature, weather type, atmospheric pressure, and an icon representing the weather.

4. Cards are sorted by temperature in ascending order.
